pricing
this section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. the market 
prices, unless otherwise noted, have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. in some cases the pricing vendor may provide prices quoted by 
a single broker or market maker. market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ from the actual sale price. securities for which a price is not available are marked 
"n/a" and are omitted from the total.
the as of price date only appears when the price date does not equal the statement date.
estimated annual figures
the estimated annual income (eai) and estimated annual yield (eay) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. these figures are not considered to be a forecast or 
guarantee of future results. these figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. since interest

estimated annual figures (continued)
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making 
investment, trading, or tax decisions. these figures assume that the position quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. a capital gain or return of principal 
may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. refer to www.pershing.com/disclosures for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures.  
accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received.
foreign currency transactions
pershing will execute foreign currency transactions as principal for your account.  pershing may automatically convert foreign currency to or from u.s. dollars for dividends and similar 
corporate action transactions unless you instruct your financial organization otherwise.  pershing's currency conversion rate will not exceed the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day, increased by up to 1%, unless a particular rate is required by applicable law.  your financial 
organization may also increase the currency conversion rate.  this conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, incurred a charge, or 
received a credit.  transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents use.
proxy vote
securities not fully paid for in your margin account may be lent by pershing to itself or others in accordance with the terms outlined in the margin agreement. the right to vote your 
shares held on margin may be reduced by the amount of shares on loan. the proxy voting instruction form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than 
the number of shares in your margin account.
variable rate securities
interest rate data for certain complex and/or variable rate securities is provided to pershing by third-party data service providers pursuant to contractual arrangements. although we 
seek to use reliable sources of information, the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, and completeness of interest rate data may vary sometimes, particularly for complex and/or variable 
rate securities and those with limited or no secondary market. as a result, we can offer no assurance as to the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of interest rate data for 
such securities. pershing may also occasionally make interest rate updates and adjustments based on its reasonable efforts to obtain accurate, reliable, timely, and/or complete 
interest rate data from other data sources, but we can similarly provide no assurance that those rates or adjustments will be accurate, reliable, timely, or complete.
when updated interest rate data is received from a third-party data service provider or adjusted by pershing, the updated data will be reflected in various sources where interest rate 
data is used or viewed, including both paper and electronic communications and data sources. prior use or communication of interest rate-related data will not be revised. since 
variable interest rates may be subject to change at any time and are only as accurate as the data received from third-party data service providers or otherwise obtained by pershing, 
interest rate data should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. all interest rate data and other information derived from and/or calculated using interest 
rates are not warranted as to accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness and are subject to change without notice. pershing disclaims any responsibility or liability to the fullest 
extent permitted by applicable law for any loss or damage arising from any reliance on or use of the interest rate data or other information derived from and/or calculated using 
interest rates in any way. you should request a current valuation for your securities from your financial adviser or broker prior to making a financial decision or placing an order or 
requesting a transaction in these securities.
structured products
structured products in this section are complex products and may be subject to special risks, which may include, but are not limited to: loss of initial investment; issuer credit risk; 
limited or no appreciation; risks associated with the underlying reference asset(s); no periodic payments; call prior to maturity (a redemption could affect the yield represented); early 
redemption fees or other applicable fees; price volatility resulting from issuer's and/or guarantor's credit quality; lower interest rates and/or yield compared to conventional debt with 
a comparable maturity; unique tax implications; concentration risk of owning the related security; limited or no secondary market; restrictions on transferability; conflicts of interest; 
and limits on participation in appreciation of underlying asset(s). to review a complete list of risks, please refer to the offering documents for the structured product. for more

structured products (continued)
information about the risks specific to your structured products, you should contact your financial institution or advisor. certain structured products are designed to make periodic 
distributions to you and any such structured product distributions you receive will be listed in the transactions section of your statement. structured product distributions may be 
listed there as "bond interest received"; however, this description is not intended to reflect a determination as to either the asset classification of the product or the u.s. tax 
treatment of such distributions.

transition to trade date plus one (t1) settlements
the u.s. will adopt a shortened settlement timeframe beginning with trade date may 28, 2024, for equities, corporate, municipal bonds and unit investment trusts. moving from a t2 to a t1 
settlement cycle will provide faster access to sale proceeds, but it also means that funds will be due on purchase transactions earlier. 
although a money market mutual fund (money fund) seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money fund.  shares 
of a money fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account.  
please see the money fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. pursuant to sec rule 10b-10(b)(1) 
confirmations are not sent for purchases into money funds processed on the sweep platform. pursuant to applicable regulation, account statements will be produced monthly or 
quarterly. balances in federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic)-insured bank deposit sweep products are not protected by securities investor protection corporation (sipc).

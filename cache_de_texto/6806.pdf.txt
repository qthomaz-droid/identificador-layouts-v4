senior investor helpline
senior investor clients or those acting on their behalf have a convenient 
way to communicate with our firm by calling us at (800) 280-4534 
monday-friday 9am-7pm eastern time.
availability of free credit balances and financial statements
under the customer protection rules of the sec [17 cfr 
§240.15c3-3], we may use funds comprising free credit balances 
carried for customer accounts here, provided that these funds are 
payable to customers on demand (i.e., are free of a lien or right of 
set-off in our favor or on behalf of some third party to whom you have 
given control). a financial statement of this organization is available for 
your personal inspection at its offices, or a copy will be mailed to you 
upon your written request.
listed options
information with respect to commissions and other charges related to 
the execution of options transactions has been included in 
confirmations of such transactions previously furnished to you and such 
information will be made available to you promptly at your request. 
promptly advise us of any material change in your investment 
objectives or financial situation.
important information if you are a margin customer (not available for 
certain retirement accounts)
if you have margin privileges, you may borrow money from us in 
exchange for pledging assets in your accounts as collateral for any 
outstanding margin loan. the amount you may borrow is based on the 
value of the eligible securities in your margin accounts. if a security has 
eligible shares, the number of shares pledged as collateral will be 
indicated below the position.
margin interest charges
we calculate interest charges on margin loans as follows: (1) multiply 
the applicable margin interest rate by the daily close of business net 
settled debit balance, and (2) divide by 360 (days). margin interest 
accrues daily throughout the month and is added to your debit balance 
at month-end. the month-end interest charge is the sum of the daily 
accrued interest calculations for the month. we add the accrued 
interest to your debit balance and start a new calculation each time the 
applicable interest rate changes and at the close of every statement 
month. for interest rate information, log into your account online and 
select your account with a margin agreement to view more information.
information regarding special memorandum account
if you have a margin account, this is a combined statement of your 
margin account and special memorandum account maintained for you 
under section 220.5 of regulation t issued by the board of governors 
of the federal reserve system. the permanent record of the special 
memorandum account as required by regulation t is available for your 
inspection at your request.
important information about auction rate securities
for certain auction rate securities there is no or limited liquidity. 
therefore, the price(s) for these auction rate securities are indicated 
by n/a (not available). there can be no assurance that a successful 
auction will occur or that a secondary market exists or will develop for 
a particular security.
structured investments risks and considerations
structured investments (structured products) are complex products and 
may be subject to special risks. investors should consider the 
concentration risk of owning the related security and their total 
exposure to any underlying asset. structured investments, which may 
appear in various statement product categories and are identified on 
the position description details line as "asset class: struct inv," may 
not perform in a manner consistent with the statement product 
category where they appear and therefore may not satisfy portfolio 
asset allocation needs for that category. for information on the risks 
and conflicts of interest related to structured investments generally, log 
in to morgan stanley online and go to 
https://mso.morganstanleyclientserv.com/publiccontent/pdf/si_conflicts
_and_risks_3_15.pdf.
security measures
this statement features several embedded security elements to 
safeguard its authenticity. one is a unique blue security rectangle, 
printed in heat-sensitive ink on the back of every page. when exposed 
to warmth, the color will disappear, and then reappear.
sipc protection
we are a member of securities investor protection corporation (sipc), 
which protects securities of its customers up to $500,000 (including 
$250,000 for claims for cash). an explanatory brochure is available 
upon request or at www.sipc.org. losses due to market fluctuation are 
not protected by sipc and assets not held with us may not be covered 
by sipc protection. to obtain information about sipc, including an 
explanatory sipc brochure, contact sipc at 1-202-371-8300 or visit

equity research ratings definitions and global investment manager 
analysis status
some equity securities may have research ratings from morgan stanley 
& co. llc or morningstar, inc. research ratings are the research 
providers' opinions and not representations or guarantees of 
performance. for more information about each research provider's 
rating system, see the research ratings on your most recent june or 
december statement (or your first statement if you have not received a 
statement for those months), go online or refer to the research 
provider's research report. research reports contain more complete 
information concerning the analyst's views and you should read the 
entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating alone. if 
your account contains an advisory component or is an advisory 
account, a gima status will apply.
credit ratings from moody's investors service and standard & poor's
the credit rating from moody's investors service and standard & poor's
